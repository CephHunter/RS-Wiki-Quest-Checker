# RS Wiki Quest Checker
## What is this?
This chrome extension adds crosses and checks next to the quest based on quest completion.

## Installation
### Easy installation
**Currently this doesn't work anymore:**

In chrome go to your extensions page (chrome://extensions/), drag and drop the .crx file, which you downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/MidasLamb/RS-Wiki-Quest-Checker/releases), in there. That's it! Now you only have to configure the extension.

### Manual installation from source
Download the zip from the [release page](https://github.com/MidasLamb/RS-Wiki-Quest-Checker/releases), unzip it. Turn on developer mode in chrome extensions and choose "Load unpacked extension."

## Configuration
Just click on the extension in the top right corner, give in your RS username and press "Save options".
